# chatServer
An implementation of a basic chat server in C to learn basic to further my understanding of the Linux socket API. 

The main implementation of the server is based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGfTjKwLQxY&t=604s&ab_channel=NirLichtman Credit to the author. 
I plan to experiment with this code by adding more functionalities to further my understanding of basic communication between two clients.
